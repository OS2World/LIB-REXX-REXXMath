REXXMATH v1.0 03/22/94 by Zhitao Zeng Footprint Software Inc.

The following are the files included in the rexxmath package:
readme            - this file         
rexxmath.doc      - documentation
rexxmath.c        - C source
makefile          - make file for WATCOM C/C++
rexxmath.lnk      - link file for WATCOM C/C++
makeibmc          - make file for IBM C/Set++
rexxmath.def      - def file for IBM C/Set++
test.cmd          - rexx script for testing some of the math functions
watcom.cmd        - batch file to compile using WATCOM C/C++
ibmc.cmd          - batch file to compile using IBM C/Set++
rexxmath.dll      - the rexxmath DLL compiled using WATCOM C/C++ 9.5b, I
                    included the WATCOM C version because it's about half
                    the size of the IBM C version.


Footprint Software is a leading financial software company, our software has
been used by almost every major Canadian financial institutions. we have a
large collection of financial functions(dates, interest, loan/mortgage,
investment analysis, financial planning, and etc.) written in C which can be
easily turned into REXX DLLs.  If you would like to purchase such DLLs or
have us to develop custom financial REXX DLLs, please send me a message and
I'll pass your requests to our Financial Toolkit group.


I have been using OS/2 for a couple of years now and I never bothered to
touch REXX until recently, and I love it! (thanks to Rob Veith and Eric
Giguere of WATCOM for introducing me to the world of REXX)
